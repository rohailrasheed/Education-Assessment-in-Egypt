# Education Assessment in Egypt

Egypt's education system has undergone significant reforms in recent years, with a focus on improving quality and accessibility for all students. These reforms have been driven by the need to modernize educational practices and ensure that students are better prepared for the demands of the 21st century. Education assessment plays a crucial role in this transformation, as it aims to evaluate student learning outcomes and enhance the overall educational experience. By implementing various assessment tools and methods, educators can gain valuable insights into students' strengths and weaknesses, allowing for more tailored instruction. Additionally, effective assessments can inform policymakers about the effectiveness of educational reforms, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. Ultimately, these efforts seek to create a more equitable education system where every student has the opportunity to succeed and contribute positively to society.

# Getting Started

To start the project, you need to use Google Colab, where the public dataset will be uploaded through the Kaggle API. After that, the data will be transformed and loaded into the machine learning model.
